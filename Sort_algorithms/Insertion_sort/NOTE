Insertion sort

Wost case: O(n^2)
Worst case spzce complexity: O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary

Nice feature: can sort a list as receiving it.

My implementation:
   There is a really small different between the a version and the b
   version. A small test show that a version is slightly faster
   (~0.001s). Which make senses since a version only have one
   assignment operation in the inner loop whereas b version have two.

Insertion sort is commonly good choice for small set. A small test
with a roughly implemented merge test shows that the threshold is
about 40 - 60. Which agree with the estimate form "Introduction to
Algorithms", 8 n^2 = 64 n lg n. Which slove to about 43. In conclusion
a size of 50 is better to use insertion sort.
