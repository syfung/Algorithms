Insertion sort

Wost case: O(n^2)
Worst case spzce complexity: O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary

Nice feature: can sort a list as receiving it.

My implementation:
   There is a really small different between the a version and the b
   version. A small test show that a version is slightly faster
   (~0.001s). Which make senses since a version only have one
   assignment operation in the inner loop whereas b version have two.
